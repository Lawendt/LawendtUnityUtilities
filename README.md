# Lawendts Unity Utilities
A set of useful scripts for Unity.

## Why?
I began to realize that I was using the same scripts in many projects and wanted to have them in a place where I could easily start to use in all projects.

## What?
There are a lot of scripts here, [attributes](https://github.com/Lawendt/UnityLawUtilities/tree/master/Assets/Editor/CustomAttributes), [editor extensions](https://github.com/Lawendt/UnityLawUtilities/tree/master/Assets/Editor), [snippets](https://github.com/Lawendt/UnityLawUtilities/tree/master/Assets/Runtime/Snippets) of useful code etc. You can check a list of ~~almost~~ all of them at the [wiki](https://github.com/Lawendt/UnityLawUtilities/wiki).

## How?
Use Unity's Package Manager and add from a git url:

https://github.com/Lawendt/LawendtUnityUtilities.git#upm

or move the files from the [Assets](https://github.com/Lawendt/LawendtUnityUtilities/tree/master/Assets) folder to your project.

## Namespace
All scripts are located under `LUT` namespace.
